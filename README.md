# Wi-Fi Hacking

Wireless Penetration Testing, often abbreviated as WPT, is an essential tool for maintaining the security of wireless networks.&#x20;



{% @mailchimp/mailchimpSubscribe %}

It is a method that involves an authorized and managed attack on a network to identify potential security weaknesses and areas of vulnerability.&#x20;

Essentially, the purpose of a wireless penetration test is to identify all potential loopholes that could be exploited in a cyber attack.&#x20;

These tests are critical in helping organizations improve the security of their wireless networks, potentially saving them from significant losses due to data breaches or unauthorized network access.

Gaining insight into how attackers could potentially exploit a network is pivotal to continuous security improvements.

### Wireless Penetration Test Attacks

During a Wireless Penetration Test (WPT), various attack strategies are employed to evaluate the strength of a wireless network's security. These may include:

* **Passive Attacks**: Where testers eavesdrop on wireless traffic to gather information without being detected.
* **Active Attacks**: Involving interacting with the network, such as attempting to break encryption, inject packets, or create fake access points.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Where the tester positions themselves between two communicating hosts to intercept and potentially modify the data being exchanged.
* **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks**: Designed to overwhelm the network's resources, effectively rendering the service unavailable to legitimate users.
* **Evil Twin Attacks**: A rogue access point is set up to mimic a legitimate network, tricking users into connecting to it to steal sensitive information.

The outcomes from these attacks aid in identifying and patching vulnerabilities, enhancing overall network resilience against malicious actors.
