# Wireless Penetration Test

Wireless Penetration Testing, often abbreviated as WPT, is an essential tool for maintaining the security of wireless networks.&#x20;

It is a method that involves an authorized and managed attack on a network to identify potential security weaknesses and areas of vulnerability.&#x20;

Essentially, the purpose of a wireless penetration test is to identify all potential loopholes that could be exploited in a cyber attack.&#x20;

These tests are critical in helping organizations improve the security of their wireless networks, potentially saving them from significant losses due to data breaches or unauthorized network access.

Gaining insight into how attackers could potentially exploit a network is pivotal to continuous security improvements.
