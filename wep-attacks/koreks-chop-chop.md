# KoreK's Chop Chop

### KoreK ChopChop Attack Explained

The KoreK ChopChop attack is a sophisticated wireless network attack that targets WEP encryption. It's named after its creator, a hacker known as KoreK. This attack allows an unauthorized user to decrypt packets without knowing the encryption key.

### **How ChopChop Attack Works**

1. The attacker captures a packet from the wireless network.
2. The attacker modifies the encrypted packet slightly and tries to resend it to the network. If the modified packet is accepted, it means the last byte of the packet was correctly guessed.
3. The attacker uses this technique to confirm the value of the last byte of the packet.
4. Once the last byte is confirmed, the attacker shortens the packet by one byte and repeats the process, effectively "chopping" off one byte at a time.
5. Eventually, the attacker can determine the entire plaintext of the packet through this process of elimination.
6. With the plaintext revealed, the attacker can analyze the structure of the encrypted packet and extract the WEP key.

### **Security Implications**

* The ChopChop attack exploits weaknesses in the WEP protocol, making the use of WEP-protected WiFi networks extremely insecure.
* It is a form of active attack since it involves the injection of modified packets back into the network.

### **Preventative Measures**

* Upgrade to WPA or WPA2 encryption, which are more secure than WEP.
* Regularly monitor network traffic for unusual activities that might indicate the presence of an attacker.
* Employ additional security measures such as MAC address filtering, though this is not a foolproof solution.

```
aireplay-ng -4 -h 00:09:5B:EC:EE:F2 -b 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 wlan0
```

Where:

* \-4 means the chopchop attack
* \-h 00:09:5B:EC:EE:F2 is the MAC address of an associated client or your card's MAC if you did fake authentication
* \-b 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 is the access point MAC address
* ath0 is the wireless interface name
