#### WPS Pixie Dust Attack

The WPS Pixie Dust attack is a type of cyberattack which targets the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) protocol, a network security standard to create a secure wireless home network. This attack takes advantage of a vulnerability in the WPS PIN method of connecting devices to a wireless network.

**How it Works**

When a device tries to connect to a WPS-enabled network, it can do so using a PIN which is an 8-digit number. This PIN is highly susceptible to brute-force attacks because it’s split into two parts; the first part contains 7-digits and the second part is a checksum of the first part, leaving the actual unknown digits to 7. The Pixie Dust attack exploits this by trying to retrieve the WPS PIN during the exchange known as the E-S1 and E-S2.

**Vulnerability**

The vulnerability comes from the fact that some WPS-enabled routers will transmit enough information during this exchange that allows attackers to deduce the PIN using advanced offline calculations. This usually happens within a matter of seconds to several hours, depending on the complexity of the PIN and the processing power available to the attacker.

**Mitigation**

To mitigate the risk of a Pixie Dust attack, it is recommended to:

* Disable WPS on your router.
* Regularly update router firmware.
* Use a strong WPA2 encryption with a complex passphrase.

Please note that not all routers are susceptible to a Pixie Dust attack, and security for wireless networks is continually evolving. It’s crucial to stay updated with the latest security practices to protect your network.
